# old_code
Old code and projects of mine.

These are some very old projects of mine and very bad attempts at programming I've done over the years.

passgen.c is for generating a password dictionary and an experiment with recursive loops.
udp.c is a very basic ANSI C program for sending a syslog packet via UDP
Syslog_Send.py is a python-based program for sending syslog events (for testing syslog servers and CEF forwarding.)
win_events.cef is a sample of fake Windows system log events via CEF for testing.
